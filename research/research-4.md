# Final Sprint
## Usability Findings

### Summary

For our user test, we were most interested in discovering how a prospective user would want to use device that allows them to track their own mood as well as the mood of a partner or loved one.  In order to obtain these insights, we conducted a "focus group" test where we explained the functionality of our Moodring 2.0, allowed the participants to experiment with the prototypes, then recorded their feedback.

### Findings

Our main finding was that everyone expressed their desire to use the ring and application in their own specific way.  This leaves us with an opportunity to provide a "default setting" for new users, but also include the option to customize certain settings.  These opportunities for customization are as follows:

### Relevance

Our findings gave us direction in how we might move forward in developing our phone application and ring hardware.  

<br> Phone Application: we learned that there are opportunities to provide "default" settings for a new user, but to also build in functionality that allows a user to customize the experience if they wish.  

<br><br>Ring Hardware: there is an opportunity to utilize the upper band on the ring with a visual notification regarding battery life or the amount of time that has passed since their partner updated their mood.
