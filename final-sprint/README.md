### Sprint Catalog

<br>The following is an overview of items we focused on during the final sprint

### Outcome 

We were able to complete all items for the final sprint, with the exception of bringing everything together in the smaller functional form. This is just because of timing, since we need to wait for the actual flex board to arrive before it can be put together! Below is an overview of the final product.

### Product Review  

<br>We are proud of this project as a team. It started as a passion research project in October and has grown into something we're all truly interested in developing and commercializing. Over the course of these sprints, we've made a lot of progress in defining the technical components and reducing the size of the prototype itself. We've also learned a lot about how to actually program the device and what goes into app development and connection of an app to a physical product. Though we didn't get it quite to the point where we are ready to launch a true Kickstarter campaign, we are prepared to continue building this product outside of this course and believe we have created a strong "proof of concept" product with the final class prototype of the moodring.

<br>To support our "proof of concept" idea, we performed user testing and also went to offices hours to discuss the idea with Alphalab gear. During that meeting we brainstormed many other use cases for the ring itself, outside of being a moodring. It could be used as a tracking device for various activities, such as "employee satisfaction on the job" and "meal tracking" too. 

<br>What we did during this sprint:
<ul>
  <li>3D print small form factor</li>
  <li>Create and order flexible board to fit with small form factor/li>
  <li>Design enhancements to app and set it up for the demo day</li>
  <li>Refinements to code for capacitive touch</li>
  <li>Refinements to code for spin function</li>
  <li>Code for sending colors from the app to the ring</li>
  <li>Code for scrolling through colors on the ring itself & blinking when color is chosen</li>
  <li>Poster</li>
   <li>Video</li>
  <li>Design renders (photos of final design vision for product)</li>
  <li>User Testing</li>
  <li>Meeting with Alphalab</li>
  <li>Clean up code and add comments</li>
 </ul>

### Product Retrospective 

<br>What went well? We continue to work very well together as a group! It was fun to put together the final demo day materials.

<br>What didn't go well? We are waiting for the flex board to arrive so we can set up our small form factor!

<br>What could we do differently? Again, being in the same place to work on (specifically the code and connection of app and ring) could happen more often and would be beneficial. Its difficult to do this in a school setting when working on various other projects simultaneously.

### Future Work

<ul>
  <li>Build small form factor</li>
<li>Build data exchange between apps over the cloud so that partners can share information with each other in the app</li>
<li>Refine sending data back to the app over bluetooth from the ring and make pages for this in the app</li>
<li>Continued user testing so we only spend our time on building features that users actually want</li>
<li>Complete a functioning prototype of the app and ring and then start getting people to use it!</li>
<li>Once we have some users and data collected, try to get some sort of funding so we can manufacture it and launch an official kickstarter campaign</li>
</ul>
