# Research Sprint 2
## Algorithm and Sensor Research

_Prompt: Identify 3-5 advanced technical approaches, code implementations, algorithms, software or sensors that are relevant to your project and that could help you make your implementation more robust_

### Summary

<br>Our research was focused into 2 separate areas: the physical wearable & the software application. We did research into technical approaches that could enhance our product separately and agreed upon them as a group. We were looking for ways to reduce the form size, improve or enhance the interaction with the wearable and to connect the app to the wearable efficiently.

### Findings

  <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things">IBM Cloud & Watson IoT platform</a> - free for first 500 connected devices </li>
</ul>

#### Physical Wearable Findings

  <li><a href="https://pulsesensor.com/products/pulse-sensor-amped">Pulse Sensor</li>
</ul>

### Relevance of Findings

#### Software tech relevance
<br> Ensuring seamless connection to the ring is critical for data exchange, so finding the right bluetooth plugin for the app that works with Cordova and acorss Ios and Android was important for our project. Also, using a data storage and cloud platform to track and gain insights from the data will be important as more data is collected and we want to make data visualizations in the future. IBM Cloud is known for being strong in security and also for its innovative abilities in the Iot space, data insights (with Watson) and with potential of turning this into an IoT project that does data exchange using Hyperledger, which is IBM's blockchain platform. Having ability to build with blockchain was one of our team goals.

#### Physical Wearable tech relevance
<br> Instead of trying to automatically detect emotions using sensor technology, the team has chosen to take the approach that asking wearers to take a more mindful approach to determining their own emotions will be more beneficial for them in the long run.  One of the main goals of the team is to increase the EQ of the wearers of MoodRing.  Perhaps in the future, sensors will be incorporated into the ring to determine how GSR and pulse data maps to the self-reported emotions of the wearer.
