__Overview__

We often feel pressure to be selfish with our time and brainpower so that we can focus on optimizing the various aspects of our lives.  One aspect that often becomes neglected is time to reflect on, strengthen, or maintain our emotional well-being or connections to the people that we care about most. Moodring2.0 solves this problem for people who want to have authentic and truly healthy emotional relationships with themselves and their romantic partners or a loved one.

__How?__

<br> Moodring2.0 uses color and light to encourage you to reflect on and express your emotions.  To set up the ring, you use the Moodring app to match specific moods or emotions you often feel to any color you want to associate with that mood. The app prompts you to do this for the 5 basic emotions, but you can also add in anything else you'd like to track. Once these colors are set, they are transmitted to the ring and when you are feeling one of those moods, you can scroll through the colors on the ring itself and record feeling that emotion by stopping on its color.

<br>To remind yourself and to reflect on your selected mood, you spin the ring clockwise-- it will display the color of the last mood you recorded. If you spin the band in the other direction, the ring displays the last emotion that was recorded by your partner on his or her ring.

<br>You can refer back to the app to see your mood tracking history over time and to remind yourself of your partnerâ€™s moods and the colors they associate with those moods too. This allows you to notice patterns and plan adjustments to your day if you would like to make a change.  It also helps you to understand your partner's emotional life at a deeper level and to feel connected to your partner in a non-intrusive way, even when you are physically apart.
