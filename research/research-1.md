### Summary

Our team has been doing research into definitions of and ways to improve emotional intelligence, emotional awareness, emotion tracking and the various products associated with all of these items since October 2017. We are confident that the "group brain" we've formed contains accurate information to guide our intuition in the right direction now as we make decisions about how to develop Moodring2.0. 

Our research for Sprint 1 focused specifically on the current form and functionality of other IoT rings that are currently on the market or being developed today. We also looked into other technologies we could use to improve interaction between the wearer and the ring. The research consisted of individual online searches and also sources sent to us by our professor, Daragh Byrne, and class peers who know about the ring we are building. Below is a summary of our findings.

### Findings

Our research has given us insights into the categories of wearable capacitive touch interfaces, the display of emotions through color, and the novelty of rings that have one defining characteristic or function. We noticed that several other "smart rings" had extremely successful Kickstarters and that none of them are mood trackers (yet!).

On the topic of capacitive touch, we found many examples of wearables using capactive touch "sliders".  The wearer simply brushes their finger against the surface of the wearable to navigate screens or states.  This is a design feature that we can incorporate into our ring for emotion selection.

Regarding the display of emotions through color we found that soft glows of light through light diffusing materials seem to be the most effective.  We want to avoid "heat spots" of light in our ring.  The goal is to display a soft-glowing band.

Lastly, we noticed that there are very successful "smart rings" on the market that differentiate themselves by performing one unique function.  For example, the Nimb ring sends an alert for help when a concealed button is held down for at least three seconds.  Also, when using the ORII ring, a wearer can touch their finger to their ear and hear phone calls from vibrations that travel from the ring, through the finger, and into the bone structures of the inner ear.  We hope to incorporate a signature physical aspect into our ring.

### Relevance

Based on our findings, the team feels confident in the decision to move forward with a capacitive touch "slider" used to select emotions, color being displayed as light shining through an opaque diffusor, and having the defining physical characteristic of a spinning middle band. Interacting with the ring is important to encourage thoughtful reporting of moods and active reflection about mood of self and a partner.
